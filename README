This is a AVL tree implementation that tries to be the most generic and
safe as possible.

Note: this implementation is not thread safe and maybe never will be,
threads are never safe.

Status

We can add items and see them sorted, there is no node removal yet.
Balance functions are ready, batch insertion is ready as well, if you want to
use it after a batch insertion you must call tree_balance, otherwise the tree
will be unreliable / unusable.

TODO
---
* Tree deletion
* Tree node deletion
* Tree node batch deletion
* Tree node post deletion routine
